Aug 14, 2016 08:34:25 PM Certain Republicans who have lost to me would rather save face by fighting me than see the U.S.Supreme Court get proper appointments. Sad! [Twitter for Android]  link
Aug 14, 2016 07:07:43 PM "Stay on message" is the chant. I always do - trade, jobs, military, vets, 2nd A, repeal Ocare, borders, etc - but media misrepresents! [Twitter for Android]  link
Aug 14, 2016 06:57:37 PM I have always been the same person-remain true to self.The media wants me to change but it would be very dishonest to supporters to do so! [Twitter for Android]  link
Aug 14, 2016 12:06:20 PM It is not "freedom of the press" when newspapers and others are allowed to say and write whatever they want even if it is completely false! [Twitter for Android]  link
Aug 14, 2016 11:55:07 AM I am not only fighting Crooked Hillary, I am fighting the dishonest and corrupt media and her government protection process. People get it! [Twitter for Android]  link
Aug 14, 2016 11:50:51 AM Crooked Hillary Clinton is being protected by the media. She is not a talented person or politician. The dishonest media refuses to expose! [Twitter for Android]  link
Aug 14, 2016 07:46:17 AM My rallies are not covered properly by the media. They never discuss the real message and never show crowd size or enthusiasm. [Twitter for Android]  link
Aug 14, 2016 07:37:37 AM If the disgusting and corrupt media covered me honestly and didn't put false meaning into the words I say, I would be beating Hillary by 20% [Twitter for Android]  link
Aug 14, 2016 07:31:23 AM The failing @nytimes, which never spoke to me, keeps saying that I am saying to advisers that I will change. False, I am who I am-never said [Twitter for Android]  link
Aug 14, 2016 07:24:48 AM The failing @nytimes talks about anonymous sources and meetings that never happened. Their reporting is fiction. The media protects Hillary! [Twitter for Android]  link

Jul 24, 2016 08:30:59 AM Sorry folks, but Bernie Sanders is exhausted, just can't go on any longer. He is trying to dismiss the new e-mails and DNC disrespect. SAD! [Twitter for Android]  link
Jul 24, 2016 08:27:56 AM There is no longer a Bernie Sanders "political revolution." He is turning out to be a weak and somewhat pathetic figure,wants it all to end! [Twitter for Android]  link
